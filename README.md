# deliverenroute
The main aim of this project is to deliver the required items from one place (or person) to another through the registered helpers who travel en route to the customer’s location in a single Web application. 

Home The global COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our lives in a manner we never imagined or prepared for. As it’s obvious, visits to restaurants, shopping malls, and multiplex theatres all come down drastically. According to The National Restaurant Association, more than 110,000 restaurants in the U.S. closed for business in 2020. On the other hand, the need for social distancing, safety concerns, and lockdowns resulted in a steep growth for delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats which grew by more than double in 2020. Even outside of food delivery, “Online Delivery” of almost everything has become a part of the new normal. 
Our problem statement arose with a question “What if ?”. Let us consider this scenario, Priya is a beautician. She has an appointment for a customer by 11 in the morning for about 3 hours. But suddenly she remembered that she forgot to give medicines which she brought in the morning to her father who was ill. Now the time is 10 am. It takes around one and half hours to go home and come back to work and also she doesn't know how to drive. Now considering the situation, what will she do? 
As we can see all other online delivery apps deliver only goods from the retailers. But what will a person do if he/she needs to deliver the items to his/her relatives/friends/colleagues/neighbours who live within their locality considering the factors like the person’s age, inability to drive, reaching on time and also to save time.
